This project simulates the real world responsibilities of a data analyst in the e-commerce industry using a scraped inventory dataset from Zepto, a leading Indian instant delivery startup. It focuses on replicating how analysts clean, explore, and analyze messy product catalog data using PostgreSQL.

Zepto, like many fast-growing e-commerce companies, maintains a massive inventory database with inconsistencies in pricing, product availability, and categorization. The goal of this project is to:

Set up the raw inventory data in SQL

Clean and convert values into standard formats

Explore product distribution and availability

Generate business insights from SQL queries to help with inventory, pricing, and revenue decisions
